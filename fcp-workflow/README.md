# FCP Auteur Workflow

A-to-Z workflow for making auteur cinema (documentary, experimental, fiction) with Final Cut Pro, Claude Code, and open source tools.

**This is not a tutorial.** This is a living document showing how one filmmaker actually works -- hacking tools together, automating everything possible, and using AI as a creative collaborator, not just an assistant.

## Who is this for

- Independent filmmakers who want to push FCP beyond its defaults
- People curious about AI-assisted filmmaking workflows
- Anyone who thinks filmmaking tools should be open and hackable (Magic Lantern spirit)
- Claude Code users who want to see it applied to creative production

## Philosophy

1. **Hack everything.** If a tool doesn't do what you need, make it. Magic Lantern unlocked Canon cameras. CommandPost unlocks FCP. Claude Code unlocks your workflow.
2. **Local first.** Transcription, semantic search, color -- run it on your machine, not in a cloud. Privacy matters when you're making documentaries about sensitive subjects.
3. **Plain text is king.** Obsidian vaults, FCPXML, SRT files, Markdown scripts. Everything should be version-controlled and searchable.
4. **Automate the boring parts.** Renaming files, generating timelines, syncing metadata, creating proxies -- let the machine handle it so you can focus on the cut.

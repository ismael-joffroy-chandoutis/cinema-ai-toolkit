# Cinema Voice Pipeline

**Voice direction for documentary filmmakers working with non-professional subjects.**

The problem: your subject recorded their voice-over. The voice is authentic, it's theirs, irreplaceable. But the delivery is inconsistent. You can't go back and re-record. You need to fix the performance after the fact.

This is ADR logic applied through AI. Not replacing the voice, repairing the performance.

## Phase 0: Source Cleaning (Before Any Voice Direction)

Your recordings exist. Before any voice direction work, you need clean, isolated, segmented audio. This section documents the full preparation pipeline.

### 0.1 Analyze First

Before applying any tool, generate a spectrogram and measure SNR.

```bash
pip install librosa matplotlib soundfile
python analyze_audio.py recording.wav
```

The script generates: spectrogram, RMS over time, low-frequency noise detection (fridge/hum), estimated SNR. Makes the problem visible before treating it.

See [`scripts/analyze_audio.py`](scripts/analyze_audio.py).

---

### 0.2 Denoise

**Tested on documentary voice-over material (16kHz Zoom recordings):**

| Tool | SNR gain | Notes | Local/Cloud |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **[DeepFilterNet 3](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet)** | +15 dB | Best denoising, fast, runs on CPU | Local |
| **[Lava-SR](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/lava-sr)** | +1 dB denoising | Adds 16→48kHz upscaling, 7s for 5min | Cloud (fal.ai) |
| **[Resemble Enhance](https://github.com/resemble-ai/resemble-enhance)** | High | Best perceptual quality, Linux/CUDA only | Local (Linux) |
| **[ElevenLabs Voice Isolator](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-isolator)** | High | Best cloud quality | Cloud, check ToS |
| **[UVR](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/)** | High | Local GUI, neural voice isolation | Local |

**Optimal pipeline (macOS without GPU):**
```bash
# Step 1: Denoise locally (DeepFilterNet, 16kHz in/out)
pip install deepfilternet
deepFilter recording.wav -o output/

# Step 2: Upscale to 48kHz (Lava-SR via fal.ai, 7s per 5min)
pip install fal-client
python scripts/enhance_fal.py output/recording_DeepFilterNet3.wav
```

**If you have "pure noise" recordings** (room tone alone, fridge alone): use Audacity's *Noise Reduction* with *Get Noise Profile*. The most precise approach for a known noise source, no ML needed.

---

### 0.3 Isolate Voice (UVR)

For recordings with heavy background or multiple room elements, [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/) is free, local, and GUI-based. It runs Demucs, MDX-Net, and VR Architecture models.

Recommended model: **UVR-DeNoise** or **MDX23C** for voice isolation from background.

---

### 0.4 Separate Speakers (Diarization)

If your recording contains multiple voices (interview, conversation), identify and extract the target speaker before cloning.

```bash
pip install whisperx
whisperx recording.wav --diarize --hf_token YOUR_TOKEN --min_speakers 1 --max_speakers 3
```

WhisperX outputs: timestamped transcript with speaker labels. Filter by target speaker, extract those segments.

For standalone diarization without transcription: [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio).

---

### 0.5 Remove Long Silences + Segment

Extract usable speech segments (5–30s), discard silence > 2s.

```bash
python scripts/process_pipeline.py recording_cleaned.wav
# Outputs: processed/02-segments/*.wav
```

What to keep: natural breath pauses (< 1s), voice cloners need them for naturalness.
What to discard: silences > 2s, takes with audible noise events, takes where the subject is not the target speaker.

---

### 0.6 Normalize

Target spec for voice cloning input:
- **-18 dBFS RMS** (ElevenLabs Professional Voice Clone requirement)
- **True peak < -3 dBFS**
- **WAV 48kHz 24-bit mono**

```bash
python scripts/process_pipeline.py recording_cleaned.wav  # handles normalization
# Or in Logic Pro / FCP: Loudness → Target -18 LUFS
```

**FCP 12** has built-in tools for this under *Audio Inspector → Audio Enhancements*:
- **Voice Isolation**: ML-based, good quality for basic cleanup
- **Noise Removal** slider
- **Hum Removal**: 50/60Hz electrical hum
- **Loudness**: target LUFS normalization

---

### 0.7 Minimum Material for Voice Cloning

| Service | Minimum clean audio |
|---------|-------------------|
| Respeecher (S2S) | 1 hour |
| ElevenLabs Professional Voice Clone | 30 minutes |
| Chatterbox (zero-shot clone) | 5 seconds |
| Sesame CSM (context audio) | 30 seconds |

## The Intervention Hierarchy

After cleaning, apply voice direction. Always start with the minimal intervention.

```
Minimal                                          Maximum
   │                                                │
   ▼                                                ▼
Enhance → Inpaint specific words → Fix delivery → Regenerate full take
(free)      (Resemble Fill)      (Respeecher)    (Sesame CSM / Chatterbox)
```

---

## Tier 0 (Before Everything): Enhance

**[Resemble Enhance](https://github.com/resemble-ai/resemble-enhance)**: Open source, Apache 2.0

Run this on every recording before making any editorial judgment. Neural denoising + enhancement. Takes audio recorded in any conditions (room, phone, car) and brings it to studio level. Preserves the speaker's idiosyncrasies. Free.

```bash
pip install resemble-enhance
resemble_enhance input.wav output_enhanced.wav --denoise --enhance
```

---

## Tier 1 (Fix Specific Moments): Inpainting

**[Resemble Fill](https://www.resemble.ai/fill/)**: Commercial (Resemble AI)

Audio inpainting. You mark the exact word, phrase, or line that doesn't work. Resemble Fill regenerates only that segment in the cloned voice, preserving everything around it: breath, room tone, adjacent delivery. The rest of the take stays untouched.

This is the right tool when the problem is localized: one line delivered flat, one word clipped, one pause too long. You don't replace the take, you repair the specific failure.

---

## Tier 2 (Fix the Delivery): Speech-to-Speech

When the problem is the entire delivery of a take (the pacing, the rhythm, the register), you need speech-to-speech: feed the take in, get the same voice with corrected performance.

### **[Respeecher](https://www.respeecher.com)**: The cinema standard

Respeecher is the professional benchmark for voice work in film. Credits include:

- *The Mandalorian*: young Luke Skywalker
- *The Book of Boba Fett*: young Luke Skywalker
- *Obi-Wan Kenobi*: Darth Vader (restoring James Earl Jones' original register)
- *The Brutalist* (2024)
- *Emilia Pérez* (2024)
- *GOLIATH* (Showtime/Paramount+): posthumous narration from Wilt Chamberlain's archival recordings
- *In Event of Moon Disaster* (IDFA 2019, Emmy): Richard Nixon documentary narration

Their core model is **speech-to-speech native**, not TTS with voice clone added on top. You feed a take (from any speaker, including yourself doing the delivery you want), they convert it to the target voice while preserving the prosody, pacing, and emotional register.

> For the inner voice of a documentary subject: record yourself or a stand-in doing the delivery you want to hear. Respeecher converts it to the subject's voice. The subject's timbre, your direction.

**Pricing** (pay-as-you-go, accessible to independents):
- $27 → 30 min speech-to-speech
- $70 → 100 min speech-to-speech
- $250 → 500 min speech-to-speech

**Ethical framework**: 4 C's, Credit, Consent, Control, Compensation. Works with deepfake detection partners (Pindrop, Reality Defender). Endorsed the NO FAKES Act.

**Access**: [respeecher.com/marketplace/filmmakers](https://www.respeecher.com/marketplace/filmmakers)

---

### **[Seed-VC](https://github.com/Plachtaa/seed-vc)**: Open source alternative for S2S

Zero-shot V2V, no training required. 1–30 sec of reference audio. Real-time option. V2 adds accent + emotion conversion.

> Practical shortcut: use a well-delivered take from the same subject as the style reference. The subject directs themselves.

```bash
pip install seed-vc
seed-vc \
  --source bad_take.wav \
  --target good_take_reference.wav \
  --output fixed_take.wav
```

---

### **[Resemble AI Speech-to-Speech](https://www.resemble.ai/voice-cloning/)**: Commercial

Real-time STS, ADR-specific workflow. Per-word timestamps for editorial precision. On-premise deployment available (important for productions with legal sensitivities around voice data). Andy Warhol's voice reconstructed from 3 minutes of archive for Netflix documentary.

**ElevenLabs ToS note**: ElevenLabs updated their Terms of Service in 2025 to claim perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free rights over voice data. For a film involving a real person's voice in a legally sensitive context, verify the current ToS before uploading.

**[ElevenLabs v3 Speech-to-Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/eleven-v3)**: Commercial

Most expressive commercial STS. Audio tags for in-script emotion control (`[whispering]`, `[hesitant pause]`). 70+ languages. Multi-speaker dialogue in one pass. Quality benchmark in the space, but see ToS note above.

---

## Tier 3 (Full Regeneration): Rebuild from Script

When a take is beyond repair and you need to regenerate from text.

### **[Sesame CSM-1B](https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm)**: Open source, Apache 2.0

The most cinematically relevant architecture for inner monologue / documentary narration. Designed to cross the uncanny valley in *conversational* speech, not clean TTS but speech with micro-pauses, breath patterns, register shifts. Processes previous audio as context, so long-form narration stays coherent in feel.

This is the model architecturally closest to the register of an inner voice monologue.

```bash
# Community wrapper with Gradio + voice cloning
# github.com/phildougherty/sesame_csm_openai
# Supports CUDA, MLX (Apple Silicon), CPU
```

### **[Chatterbox](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox)**: Open source, MIT (Resemble AI)

Best open-source TTS for regeneration. Emotion exaggeration control. Beats ElevenLabs in blind tests (63.8% preference). Zero-shot clone from 5 seconds. 23 languages.

```bash
pip install chatterbox-tts
python -c "
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained('resemble-ai/chatterbox')
wav = model.generate(
    'Text to regenerate.',
    audio_prompt_path='subject_reference.wav',
    exaggeration=0.4
)
model.save(wav, 'output/result.wav')
"
```

## Full Workflow for Documentary Post-Production

```
1. ENHANCE ALL RECORDINGS
   └── Resemble Enhance on everything (free, open source)
       → studio baseline regardless of original conditions

2. EDIT FIRST
   └── The edit reveals which takes are fixable and which need intervention

3. IDENTIFY INTERVENTION LEVEL per take
   ├── Bad word/phrase only?
   │   └── Resemble Fill (inpaint the specific segment)
   ├── Bad delivery of full take?
   │   └── Respeecher S2S (record the delivery you want → convert to subject's voice)
   │       OR Seed-VC (use a good take as style reference)
   └── No good take exists, working from script?
       └── Sesame CSM (long-form conversational narration)
           OR Chatterbox (best open-source TTS clone)

4. MATCH ROOM TONE
   └── Any generated segment needs to match the acoustic environment
       of surrounding material. Impulse response convolution in
       DaVinci Fairlight, Pro Tools, or Audacity.

5. FINAL MIX
   └── DaVinci Fairlight / Pro Tools: levels, EQ, compression
```
